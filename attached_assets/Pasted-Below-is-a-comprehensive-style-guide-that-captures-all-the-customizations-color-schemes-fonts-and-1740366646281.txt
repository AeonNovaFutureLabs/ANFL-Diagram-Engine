Below is a comprehensive style guide that captures all the customizations, color schemes, fonts, and design elements we’ve discussed. This guide is intended to help you create a consistent, sleek, and modern look across your documents, diagrams, and flowcharts—perfect for Aeon Nova Future Labs and any related collateral.

1. Core Color Palette
	•	Deep Midnight Blue (myblue):
	•	RGB: (26, 26, 46)
	•	Usage: Primary text for headers, section titles, borders, and key elements in diagrams.
	•	Subdued Bronze (mybronze):
	•	RGB: (205, 127, 50)
	•	Usage: Accent color for dates, bullet points, icons, and subtle highlights. Replace bright yellows for a refined look.
	•	Lighter Contrast Blue (mysecondary):
	•	RGB: (51, 51, 76)
	•	Usage: Secondary text, subheadings, and supporting graphic elements.
	•	Background Gray (bggray):
	•	RGB: (230, 230, 230)
	•	Usage: Overall background color for documents and diagrams, providing a neutral canvas.
	•	Neutral Black (black):
	•	RGB: (0, 0, 0)
	•	Usage: Standard text where high contrast is required.

2. Typography
	•	Preferred Fonts:
	•	For Code & Monospaced Text: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Cascadia Code, MesloLGS NF.
	•	For General Text: Helvetica or a similar clean sans-serif font.
	•	Font Settings (for VSCode & LaTeX):
	•	Font Size: 20–22pt (for coding in VSCode); adjust accordingly in documents for readability.
	•	Line Height: 1.2–1.3 for comfortable reading.
	•	Letter Spacing: 0.5–1px to add a subtle modern touch.
	•	Font Ligatures: Enabled for code editors to enhance the aesthetic of symbols.

3. Visual and Diagram Styling
	•	Flow Charts & Diagrams:
	•	Shapes:
	•	Use rounded rectangles and circles for nodes to convey a sleek, futuristic vibe.
	•	Consider using hexagons or custom “techy” shapes for key decision points.
	•	Arrows & Connectors:
	•	Use solid or gradient arrows with subtle gold accents to maintain visual hierarchy.
	•	Experiment with arrowheads that are minimal yet distinctive (e.g., simple triangle or chevron shapes).
	•	Line Weights:
	•	Standard line weight: 1–1.5pt for primary connectors.
	•	Use thicker lines (2pt) for main pathways or boundaries.
	•	Dotted or dashed lines (0.5–1pt) can indicate secondary or optional paths.
	•	Borders & Gradients:
	•	Add subtle gradients (for instance, from myblue to mysecondary) on backgrounds of boxes or diagram nodes.
	•	Consider soft shadows or border glows in mybronze for depth.
	•	Bullet Points:
	•	Standard bullet: a simple solid dot in mybronze.
	•	For enhanced diagrams, consider using custom icons or emojis (e.g., ★ or ➤) sparingly to indicate milestones or highlights.
	•	Emojis & Icons:
	•	Use icons that match the futuristic and minimalist aesthetic.
	•	For example, consider using a small 🚀 for “launch” nodes, 🔒 for security elements, and ⚙️ for configuration or process steps.
	•	Ensure that the icons’ colors match your palette (convert them to match your bronze/blue tones if needed).

4. Custom Style Files (LaTeX) & VSCode Settings
	•	LaTeX:
	•	Incorporate your custom color definitions and font settings in your preamble (as shown in your customcolors.sty).
	•	Use packages like tikz for diagramming with custom node shapes, arrows, and gradients.
	•	Example snippet for TikZ diagrams:

\\usetikzlibrary{shapes, arrows, shadows, backgrounds}
\\tikzstyle{nodeStyle} = [rectangle, rounded corners, draw=mybronze, fill=myblue!10, drop shadow, text centered, minimum height=2em]
\\tikzstyle{arrowStyle} = [thick,->,>=stealth, draw=mybronze]


	•	VSCode:
	•	Maintain your VSCode settings file for a sleek coding experience as provided. Adjust the "workbench.colorCustomizations" and "editor.fontFamily" settings to reflect the above colors and fonts.
	•	Customize additional settings like bracket pair colorization, ruler guides, and mini map configurations to create a cohesive development environment.

5. Application in Business Offerings & Use Cases
	•	Product & Service Naming:
	•	Use alternative names (see Product Name Alternatives above) to give a refined, futuristic feel to offerings (e.g., “Quantum Sanctum” for secure data storage, “Guardian AI” for fraud detection).
	•	Marketing Messaging:
	•	Use sleek, modern language: “Empowering privacy with next-generation AI,” “Where technology meets timeless elegance,” or “Innovating securely for a digital renaissance.”
	•	Diagram Use Cases:
	•	Map out your decentralized architecture, privacy protocols, and modular AI systems using flow charts that incorporate the defined shapes, colors, and icons.
	•	Highlight business cases such as data sovereignty dashboards, enterprise AI integrations, and secure blockchain systems with clean, modern visualizations.

By incorporating these comprehensive style preferences and design elements, you can create a visually cohesive and compelling suite of documents, diagrams, and presentations that truly embody the sophisticated and futuristic spirit of Aeon Nova Future Labs.
